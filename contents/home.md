#### About Me

During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege to participate in summer research at the [Kihara Lab](https://kiharalab.org/) at Purdue University, working on **protein–ligand docking** and **biomolecule design**. I also collaborated with [Prof. Guangwei Zhang](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/guangwei-zhang/) at the University of Southern California on **3D reconstruction of mouse spinal cord atlases**. My work involved applying AI-driven protein design models, molecular docking pipelines, and 3D modeling tools to tackle problems in computational biology and structural bioinformatics.

#### Research Interests
Computational Biology, Protein–RNA Interaction, Molecular Design, Structure Prediction.
